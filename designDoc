Your design doc should be at least 200 words, and no more than 500
words long. It should be a high-level description of algorithms/approaches that
you have tried or plan to try. Additionally, you must include your reasoning
for what led you to these approaches, and why you think they will work.


PROBLEM:
Formally, you’re given an undirected graph G = (V, E), an integer k, and
an integer s, where each node in the graph denotes a student, and each edge
(v1, v2) denotes that students v1 and v2 are friends. The integer k denotes the
number of buses available and the integer s denotes the number of students that
can fit on a single bus. Furthermore, you’re given a list L, where each element
Lj is some subset of V which corresponds to a group that should be kept apart.
You must return a partition of G – a set of sets of vertices Vi such that
V1∪V2∪V3, ∪...∪Vk = V and ∀i 6= j, Vi∩Vj = ∅. Additionally, ∀i, 0 < |Vi
| ≤ s.
In other words, every bus must be non-empty, and must not have more students
on it than its capacity allows.
